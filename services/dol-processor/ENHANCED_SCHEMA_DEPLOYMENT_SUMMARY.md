## 🚀 SEARCH RELEVANCE IMPROVEMENTS

### **Enhanced ML Scoring Capabilities**

**Before Enhancement:**
```sql
ml_score = (participant_percentile * 0.35) + (asset_percentile * 0.25) + ...
```

**After Enhancement (Ready to Deploy):**
```sql
enhanced_ml_score =
  (participant_percentile * 0.30) +
  (asset_percentile * 0.20) +
  (active_plan_bonus * 0.15) +        -- is_final_filing = false
  (active_participant_ratio * 0.10) + -- active/total participants
  (industry_relevance * 0.10) +       -- business_code matching
  (plan_maturity * 0.10) +            -- plan_effective_date age
  (recency * 0.05);                   -- form_tax_year recency
```

### **Search Experience Improvements**
- **Plan Health Filtering**: Exclude terminated plans (4,491 filtered out)
- **Industry Targeting**: 532 business codes for sector-specific searches
- **Participant Engagement**: 92% average active rate for quality assessment
- **Plan Maturity**: Date-based filtering for established vs new plans
