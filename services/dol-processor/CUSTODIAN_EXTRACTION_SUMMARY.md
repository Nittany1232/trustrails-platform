# DOL Schedule C Custodian Data Extraction - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

We have successfully implemented a robust custodian data extraction solution that properly extracts real custodian information from DOL Form 5500 Schedule C Part 1 Item 2 data. The hierarchical search widget now has access to comprehensive, real-world custodian relationships.

### Data Quality Verification
‚úÖ **Real custodian names extracted**: Fidelity, Principal, ADP, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, etc.
