# Verifying Cloud Logging IAM Permissions

## Check in GCP Console

1. **Go to IAM page:**
   https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=trustrails-faa3e

2. **Look for the service account:**
   - Email: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@trustrails-faa3e.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - It should have these roles:
     - **Firebase Admin SDK Admin Service Agent** (existing)
     - **Logs Writer** (newly added) ← This is what we need

3. **If "Logs Writer" is not there:**
   - Click the pencil icon next to the service account
   - Click "ADD ANOTHER ROLE"
   - Search for "Logs Writer" (under Logging category)
   - Click "SAVE"

## Alternative: Check Specific Permissions

1. **Go to Policy Troubleshooter:**
   https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/troubleshooter?project=trustrails-faa3e

2. **Test these settings:**
   - Principal: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@trustrails-faa3e.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Resource: `trustrails-faa3e`
   - Permission: `logging.logEntries.create`

3. **Result should show:** ✅ ALLOW

## What's Currently Happening

Based on the code changes I can see, your app is now:

1. **Using Firestore fallback** - When Cloud Logging fails, it automatically writes to Firestore instead
2. **Non-blocking** - Login and other critical operations work regardless of Cloud Logging status
3. **Logging status** - You can see in the browser console if it's using Cloud Logging or Firestore

## Testing in the App

1. **Login to admin panel**
2. **Go to:** `/admin/audit-logs`
3. **Click:** "Cloud Logs" tab
4. **Check browser console** (F12) for messages like:
   - `[Cloud Logging] Permission denied - falling back to Firestore logging`
   - `[Cloud Logging] Successfully initialized`

## Expected Timeline

- IAM permissions typically propagate within **2-5 minutes**
- Sometimes it can take up to **10 minutes** in rare cases
- If it's been longer than 10 minutes, double-check the IAM settings

## Current Status

Your app is configured correctly and will:
- ✅ Use Cloud Logging when permissions are granted
- ✅ Fall back to Firestore when Cloud Logging isn't available
- ✅ Continue working regardless of logging backend
- ✅ Show audit logs (from Firestore) even without Cloud Logging
