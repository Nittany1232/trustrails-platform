# Cloud Logging Status - TrustRails

## ✅ Configuration Complete
- **Credentials**: `/home/stock1232/projects/trustrails/credentials/firebase-admin.json`
- **Project ID**: `trustrails-faa3e`
- **Service Account**: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@trustrails-faa3e.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Environment Variable**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set in `.env.local`

## ⏳ Waiting for IAM Permissions
The IAM permissions are currently propagating. This typically takes 2-10 minutes.

### Required IAM Role
- **Role Name**: Logs Writer (`roles/logging.logWriter`)
- **Service Account**: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@trustrails-faa3e.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### How to Verify in GCP Console
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=trustrails-faa3e
2. Look for the service account email
3. Verify it has "Logs Writer" role listed

## 🔄 Current System Behavior

### What's Working Now:
1. **Authentication**: ✅ Working (non-blocking)
2. **Audit Logging**: ✅ Using Firestore fallback
3. **Health Checks**: ✅ Showing Cloud Logging as "pending"
4. **Cloud Logs Tab**: ✅ Shows friendly "permissions pending" message

### Automatic Fallback Chain:
```
1. Try Cloud Logging → 
2. If permission denied → Use Firestore → 
3. If Firestore fails → Log to console
```

## 📊 How to Check Status

### In the Application:
1. Navigate to `/admin/audit-logs`
2. Click "Cloud Logs" tab
3. You'll see one of:
   - **"Cloud Logging permissions pending"** - Still waiting for IAM
   - **Actual logs** - Cloud Logging is working!

### Via Command Line:
```bash
# Test permissions
node test-logging-simple.js

# When you see "✅ Write permission granted!" - it's working!
```

### In Browser Console (F12):
Look for these messages:
- `[Cloud Logging] Permission denied - falling back to Firestore` - Still waiting
- `[Cloud Logging] Successfully initialized` - It's working!

## 🎯 No Action Required
The system will automatically start using Cloud Logging once permissions are active. No restart needed!

## 📝 Logs Location While Waiting
All audit logs are currently being saved to:
- **Firestore Collection**: `compliance_events`
- **Critical Events**: `critical_events`

These will continue to be saved even after Cloud Logging is active (for redundancy).
