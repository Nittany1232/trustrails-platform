# Transfer Investigation Results

## Transfer ID: v5-test-a17d133f-f4ae-4e07-807b-7f342cc5d1ce

### Issue
User reported: "I approved the documents and should be in receive but it went back to approve documents"

### Investigation Findings

1. **Transfer Status**: ❌ Transfer document not found in rollovers collection
2. **Events Status**: ✅ 5 events exist in events collection

### Event Timeline
```
1. 2025-08-21T23:40:03 - rollover.started (custodian-2)
2. 2025-08-22T00:44:43 - rollover.acknowledged (custodian-1)  
3. 2025-08-22T00:44:50 - rollover.documents_submitted (custodian-1)
4. 2025-08-22T00:45:03 - rollover.documents_verified (custodian-1) ✅
5. 2025-08-22T00:47:01 - blockchain.v5.agreement (custodian-1) ✅
```

### Root Cause
The transfer document has been **deleted from the database**, leaving orphaned events. This causes the UI to display incorrect state because:
- Events exist showing document approval completed
- No rollover document exists to compute proper state
- UI falls back to default/error state

### Resolution
The document approval flow is working correctly (proper event sequence exists). This is a data integrity issue specific to this deleted transfer.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Clear browser cache/local storage to remove cached reference
2. Create new test transfer to verify flow works properly
3. Clean up orphaned events from database

### System Status
- Document approval flow: ✅ Working correctly
- Event creation: ✅ Working correctly  
- State computation: ✅ Working (when transfer document exists)
- Issue: Data integrity problem with deleted transfer
