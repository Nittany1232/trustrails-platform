# Custodian Integration Portal - Implementation Status

## Overview
Implementation of self-service integration portal for custodians to configure widgets, manage API keys, and set up webhooks.

## Architecture
- **Admin Control**: Dual toggles for Widget and API access (independent control)
- **Self-Service Portal**: Custodians configure their own integrations at `/custodians/dashboard/[id]/integrations`
- **Audit Integration**: All actions logged via existing UnifiedAuditLogger
- **UI Consistency**: Follows existing toggle patterns from CustodianStatusManager

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Admin Toggle Component
**Location**: Integration now directly in `/home/stock1232/projects/trustrails/components/custodian/CustodianStatusManager.tsx`
- Two separate toggles following existing patterns (like Active/Verified)
- Widget Access: Controls embeddable widget functionality
- API Access: Controls programmatic API and webhook access
- Each toggle has Switch â†’ Confirmation â†’ API call â†’ Success/Error flow
- Full audit logging for all toggle actions
- Visual consistency with existing admin controls (badges, icons, layout)

### 2. API Endpoint
**Location**: `/home/stock1232/projects/trustrails/app/api/admin/custodian/[custodianId]/integration/route.ts`
- POST endpoint accepts `type` ('widget' or 'api') and `enabled` (boolean)
- GET endpoint returns status of both widget and API toggles
- Admin authentication required
- Firestore updates with separate timestamps for each toggle type
- Comprehensive audit logging with integration type tracking

### 3. Data Model Updates
**Location**: `/home/stock1232/projects/trustrails/lib/custodians.ts`
- Added separate integration fields to Custodian interface:
  - `widgetEnabled?: boolean`
  - `widgetEnabledAt?: any` (Firestore timestamp)
  - `widgetEnabledBy?: string` (Admin UID)
  - `apiEnabled?: boolean`
  - `apiEnabledAt?: any` (Firestore timestamp)
  - `apiEnabledBy?: string` (Admin UID)

### 4. Integration Dashboard
**Location**: `/home/stock1232/projects/trustrails/app/custodians/dashboard/[custodianId]/integrations/page.tsx`
- Full self-service portal for custodians
- Four main tabs:
  - **Widget**: Embed code generation and configuration
  - **API Keys**: Key management (UI ready, generation pending)
  - **Webhooks**: Event subscriptions (UI ready, configuration pending)
  - **Documentation**: Links to guides and references
- Access control: Only available when integration is enabled
- Audit logging for all access

### 5. Admin Interface Integration
**Location**: `/home/stock1232/projects/trustrails/components/custodian/CustodianStatusManager.tsx`
- Added CustodianIntegrationToggle to admin controls
- Displayed alongside Active/Verified toggles
- Maintains UI consistency with existing controls

## Implementation Details

### Cross-Repository Strategy
- **Documentation**: `trustrails-platform/docs/`
- **Implementation**: `trustrails/` repository
- **Widget Package**: `trustrails-platform/packages/rollover-widget/`

### UI/UX Patterns
- Consistent with existing toggle patterns (KYB, Active status)
- Dark theme with gray-900 cards and gray-800 backgrounds
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Loading states with Loader2 spinner
- Success/error alerts with appropriate styling

### Security & Compliance
- Admin-only toggle control
- Custodian-scoped access to integration portal
- All actions logged to UnifiedAuditLogger
- SOC 2 compliance maintained
- Tier-based authentication info displayed (OAuth for banks, API keys for HR)

## Pending Implementation ðŸš§

### 1. API Key Generation
- Backend service for key generation
- Secure storage in KMS
- Key rotation mechanism
- Rate limiting configuration

### 2. Webhook Configuration
- Endpoint registration system
- Event subscription management
- Webhook signature verification
- Retry logic and dead letter queue

### 3. Widget Advanced Features
- Custom theming interface
- Event callbacks configuration
- Analytics integration
- A/B testing support

### 4. Documentation & SDKs
- Complete API documentation
- Language-specific SDKs (JS, Python, Java, .NET)
- Integration guides and tutorials
- Video walkthroughs

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Admin can enable/disable integration for a custodian
- [x] Toggle shows confirmation dialog before action
- [x] Success/error messages display appropriately
- [x] Audit events are logged correctly
- [x] Custodian can access integration portal when enabled
- [x] Access denied when integration is disabled
- [x] Widget embed code displays with correct custodian ID
- [x] Copy to clipboard functionality works
- [ ] API key generation (pending implementation)
- [ ] Webhook configuration (pending implementation)

## Migration Notes

When migrating to monorepo:
1. Move all `/app/custodians/` routes to `trustrails-platform/apps/trustrails/app/custodians/`
2. Update import paths for shared components
3. Extract common types to `@trustrails/shared-types` package
4. Ensure audit logger is available as shared service

## Git Commits

### trustrails repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add custodian integration portal

Implements architecture from trustrails-platform/docs/CUSTODIAN_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md
- Add admin toggle for integration access
- Create self-service integration dashboard
- Integrate with existing audit system
- Follow established UI/UX patterns"
```

### trustrails-platform repository
```bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: Complete integration portal implementation status

- Document completed components and endpoints
- Track pending features for phase 2
- Include testing checklist and migration notes"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2 Features**:
   - Implement API key generation backend
   - Add webhook configuration system
   - Create SDK packages

2. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for toggle component
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Create E2E tests for full flow

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guides for custodians
   - Write API documentation
   - Record video tutorials

## Success Metrics

- Integration adoption rate by custodians
- Time to first API call after enabling
- Widget implementation success rate
- Support ticket reduction for integration issues
