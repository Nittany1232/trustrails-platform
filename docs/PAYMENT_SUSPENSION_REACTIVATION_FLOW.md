# Payment Suspension & Reactivation Flow

## Real-World Use Case: Non-Payment Handling

### The Business Scenario
1. **Custodian doesn't pay invoice** → Admin deactivates them
2. **Custodian makes payment** → Admin reactivates them
3. **System automatically handles wallet setup** → Ready to transact immediately

## How The System Works NOW (After Fix)

### When You DEACTIVATE a Custodian (Non-Payment)

```
Admin clicks "Deactivate" toggle
↓
Status changes to Inactive
↓
All users blocked from access
↓
Wallet remains in Secret Manager (not deleted)
↓
Blockchain whitelist unchanged
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Access blocked immediately
- ✅ Wallet preserved for reactivation
- ✅ No blockchain changes needed
- ✅ Audit trail created

### When You REACTIVATE a Custodian (Payment Received)

```
Admin clicks "Activate" toggle
↓
System checks: Does wallet exist?
↓
┌─ YES: Use existing wallet ──────┐
│                                  │
├─ NO: AUTO-GENERATE NEW WALLET ──┤
│   ├─ Create wallet              │
│   ├─ Store in Secret Manager    │
│   ├─ Whitelist on blockchain    │
│   └─ Update database            │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
↓
Status changes to Active
↓
Full access restored
```

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ Access restored immediately
- ✅ **NEW: Wallet auto-generated if missing**
- ✅ **NEW: Blockchain whitelisting automatic**
- ✅ Ready for transfers immediately
- ✅ Audit trail with wallet creation logged

## The Code Changes Made

### Before (Problem)
The status toggle ONLY changed the active/inactive flag:
```typescript
// Old behavior - just toggle status
updateData.isActive = isActive;
```

### After (Solution)
The activation now includes automatic wallet setup:
```typescript
if (isActive && !custodianData?.wallet?.address) {
  // Auto-generate wallet during activation
  const walletInfo = await walletService.generateAndStoreWallet(custodianId);
  
  // Set blockchain whitelist based on plan
  await blockchainService.setCustodianLevel(
    walletInfo.address,
    custodianData.level,
    adminUser.uid
  );
  
  // Update database with wallet info
  updateData.wallet = {
    address: walletInfo.address,
    type: 'platform',
    createdAt: now
  };
}
```

## Payment Suspension Workflow

### Step 1: Invoice Overdue
```bash
# Admin deactivates custodian
POST /api/admin/custodian/status
{
  "custodianId": "xxx",
  "isActive": false,
  "reason": "Invoice #INV-2024-001 overdue"
}
```

**Result:**
- Custodian and all users blocked
- Wallet preserved
- Clear audit trail

### Step 2: Payment Received
```bash
# Admin reactivates custodian
POST /api/admin/custodian/status
{
  "custodianId": "xxx", 
  "isActive": true,
  "reason": "Payment received for Invoice #INV-2024-001"
}
```

**Result:**
- Access restored
- Wallet auto-generated if needed
- Blockchain configured
- Ready for business

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Legacy Custodians (Pre-Wallet System)
**Scenario:** Old custodian has `walletAddress` but no wallet in Secret Manager

**Solution:** 
- On reactivation, system generates new wallet
- Stores in Secret Manager
- Updates to new wallet structure

### 2. Partial Setup Custodians
**Scenario:** Database has wallet address but Secret Manager lost the key

**Solution:**
- System detects missing private key
- Generates new wallet on activation
- Maintains business continuity

### 3. Multiple Suspension Cycles
**Scenario:** Custodian suspended/reactivated multiple times

**Solution:**
- First reactivation: Generate wallet once
- Subsequent reactivations: Reuse existing wallet
- No duplicate wallets created

## Admin Dashboard Behavior

### Visual Indicators
- **Active + Has Wallet**: Green status, wallet address shown
- **Active + No Wallet**: Green status, generates wallet automatically
- **Inactive + Has Wallet**: Red status, wallet preserved
- **Inactive + No Wallet**: Red status, wallet generated on reactivation

### Admin Actions Required
1. **To Suspend**: Toggle Active → Inactive (one click)
2. **To Reactivate**: Toggle Inactive → Active (one click)
3. **Nothing else needed** - System handles wallet automation

## Testing the Flow

```bash
# Test script to verify suspension/reactivation
node scripts/test-custodian-suspension-flow.js <custodianId>

# What it tests:
✅ Wallet persists during deactivation
✅ Wallet auto-generated on reactivation if missing
✅ Blockchain whitelisting automatic
✅ Can sign transactions after reactivation
✅ Database consistency maintained
```

## Important Notes

### For Admins
- **Never manually delete wallets** - Let the system manage them
- **Activation = Full Setup** - One toggle does everything
- **Safe to suspend/reactivate** - No data loss

### For Developers
- Status endpoint now includes wallet generation logic
- Wallet generation is idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
- Blockchain operations are fault-tolerant
- Audit logging tracks all wallet operations

## Summary

The system now works exactly as you intended:
- **Deactivation** = Access control only (preserves everything)
- **Activation** = Access + Automatic wallet setup if needed
- **Payment suspension** = Fully supported use case
- **No manual intervention** = Everything automated

This ensures custodians can be safely suspended for non-payment and instantly restored to full functionality when they pay.
